        <h1>You know me now!</h1>

        <p>Well, thanks for playing my little game.  As I said, we now know a little about each other.  I know your name, and you know I spent some time on a submarine and traveled under the ice.  This voyage was done in 1996 as part 2 of a 6 part, long term, unclassified science mission known as Scicex (Science Exercise) to study the efects of climate change on the polar ice cap. Below ae some pictures taken on the mission.</p>
